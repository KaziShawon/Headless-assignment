## About the Project
For this project we have to modify the given sample code in such a way so that we can track and detect pose data from 4 different video streams at one go. So basically the idea is: we have to parallely extract frames from 4 videos and merge every 4 frames into a single frame and run that frame through mmdet + mmpose.

### Goals
- **Task 1**: Apply multithreading to read frames with opencv. The steps are:
   - From every frame of respective four videos we combine them and create a single image.
   - If a video is finished then we need to continue giving blank image until most lengthy video continues and combine the images and pass it to inference.

- **Task 2**: Apply mmdet + mmpose
    - Of every combined image we run inference and get the output image.
    - We pass the predicted image to opencv videowrite method to save it as a video.

### Deliverables
- **Deliverable 1**: A script that embrace multithreading with OpenCV and returns images.
- **Deliverable 2**: Modified script of the given example to incorporate the multithreading and mmdet + pose estmation + object tracking
- **Deliverable 3**: A alternative script that doesn't use multithreading but do the job.

## Code Explantaion
- Have a look at the [project directory structure](#project-directory-structure) and the [folder overview](#folder-overview) to understand where to store/upload your contribution.
- If you're creating a task, go to the tasks folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with tasks details and goals to help other contributors understand.
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname (where n is the task number)_ ex: task-1-information-gathering, task-2-exploratory-data-analysis, etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your file names (jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
- Always document your classes, functions and notebooks to help others understand their objective.
